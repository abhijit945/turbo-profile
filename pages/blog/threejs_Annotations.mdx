# Three.JS with Annotations

ThreeJS is a powerful library that enables developers to create interactive 3D
visualizations and animations on the web. React Three Fiber is a library that
builds upon ThreeJS and allows developers to use declarative React syntax to
create and manipulate 3D scenes. In this blog post, we will explore how to use
React Three Fiber to add annotations to a ThreeJS scene.

Annotations are a great way to provide additional information about a 3D scene
to users. They can be used to highlight specific areas of interest, explain
features or functionality, or provide instructions on how to interact with the
scene. With React Three Fiber, adding annotations to a 3D scene is
straightforward.

To get started, we first need to set up a ThreeJS scene using React Three Fiber.
We can do this by creating a new React component and importing the necessary
libraries:

```js
import React, { useRef } from 'react'
import { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber'
import * as THREE from 'three'
```

In the component, we can create a ThreeJS scene by defining a canvas element
using the Canvas component:

```js
function MyScene() {
  const cameraRef = useRef()
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <perspectiveCamera ref={cameraRef} position={[0, 0, 5]} />
    </Canvas>
  )
}

```

This creates a simple 3D scene with a camera positioned at the origin.

Next, we can add annotations to the scene by creating new React components that
represent the annotations. For example, we can create a component that displays
a tooltip when the user hovers over a specific part of the scene:

```js
function Annotation() {
  const meshRef = useRef()
  return (
    <mesh ref={meshRef} position={[1, 1, 1]}>
      <boxBufferGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
      <Html position={[0, 0, 0]}>
        <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'hotpink', padding: '0.25rem 0.5rem' }}>
          <p>This is an annotation!</p>
        </div>
      </Html>
    </mesh>
  )
}

```

This component creates a 3D box with a pink material and adds an HTML element as
a child of the mesh using the Html component from React Three Fiber. The HTML
element contains a message that will be displayed when the user hovers over the
box.

Finally, we can add the Annotation component to our scene by rendering it inside
the Canvas component:

```js
function MyScene() {
  const cameraRef = useRef()
  return (
    <Canvas>
      <perspectiveCamera ref={cameraRef} position={[0, 0, 5]} />
      <Annotation />
    </Canvas>
  )
}
```

This will add the `Annotation` component to the scene, and the message will be
displayed when the user hovers over the pink box.

## Onclick position

If you want to create annotations on click, then you can achieve this by adding
an `OnClick` event on the parent i.e. Annotation's Mesh.

```js
onClick={(e: ThreeEvent<MouseEvent> | any) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    const uuid = uuidv4();
    const data = {
        uuid,
        position: e.point,
    };
}}
```

In the Html element you can use the `data.position` and pass it by doing:

```js
<Html
    key={uuidv4()}
    prepend
    zIndexRange={[100, 0]}
    position={[
        position.x,
        position.y,
        position.z,
    ]}>
    </Html>
```

In conclusion, React Three Fiber provides a simple and intuitive way to add
annotations to a ThreeJS scene. By using declarative React syntax and the Html
component, developers can easily create informative and interactive 3D
visualizations that engage users and enhance their understanding of complex data
or concepts.
