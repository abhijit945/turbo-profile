## Experiments with STL vs glTF

I wanted to create a 3D viewer using an .stl file but the rendering was very
choppy with 5-6 frames per second with every drag/pan or zoom action. The output
was choppy [1] and [2], FPS would decrease even more when we use
`meshStandardMaterial` with a `TextureLoader`.

<div className='p-4 flex items-center flex-col m-2'>
  <img width="500" height="500" alt="Picture of the f16" src="/assets/three/f16.png"/>
  <img width="500" height="500" alt="Picture of the 777" src="/assets/three/777.png"/>
</div>

```ts
const colorMap = useLoader(TextureLoader, '[...].jpg');
const geom = useLoader(STLLoader, '[...].stl');
```

```ts
<mesh
    {...props}
    ref={ref}>
    <meshStandardMaterial map={colorMap} />
    <primitive object={geom} attach="geometry" />
</mesh>
```

## Why glTF

> glTF is a 3D file format maintained by the Khronos Group. It is an all-purpose
> transmission format, but it has been adopted by Google as the format of choice
> for Augmented Reality (AR) on Android’s Scene Viewer. GLB is a binary
> container format of glTF. It bundles all the textures and mesh data into a
> single file.

> glTF works well for web-based AR. In fact, web giants like Facebook and Google
> have adopted the format for their AR services due to its efficient design and
> sheer speed.

> glTF was designed to maximize web browser compatibility – something that 3D
> file formats like FBX lack. So it’s become a go-to for businesses blending 3D
> models and the World Wide Web.

### After Refactor

```ts
const ref = useRef<Mesh>(null!);
const { scene } = useGLTF(url);
// ...

useLayoutEffect(() => {
    scene?.traverse(obj => {
      if ((obj as Mesh).isMesh) {
        obj.castShadow = true;
        obj.receiveShadow = true;
      }
    });
  }, [scene, hotspotList]);

// ...

return (<primitive ref={ref} castShadow receiveShadow object={scene} />)
```
